How to automate your development experience with few lines of code.

- Clone from github / Docker
- from directory
  -  run
    - `npm i -g ./`
      - This sets the command `create-project` globally on your machine
    - `create-project` from any directory
    - `create-project fresh-project` and a new folder appears
    - Choose type of project (for cli interaction)
  - Customize the template outputs and CLI i.e. (the few lines of code in the bin)
- inside project
  - add feature with `create-project add-feature`
