# How to automate your development experience with few lines of code.

- Use `create-project <command>` in any directory
- Customize the projects to your liking and automate your workflow
  - Add a new folder to the projects folder and it will be integrated with interactive mode
- run `create-project` to get a list of commands and options.

> This can be customized for any codebase language or style and the magic is done in few lines of code.


## Installation 


- Either clone from github / Docker
- from that directory,
  -  run `npm i -g ./`
      - This sets the command `create-project` globally on your machine
    - use `create-project` from any directory
    - `create-project fresh-project` and a new folder appears (I started building this template yesterday)
    - Use `create-project interactive` to get a CLI experience to setup your project.
  - Customize the template outputs on the fly (along with the few lines of code in the bin)
- also see the `create-project add-feature` command to automate building folders.
